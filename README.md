This was a simple unity based game I made to learn about Unity for a UROP project in my second year of university.

Found some issues with the optimisation from back then, and then pushing it to Github for posterity.

It's a simple arena based shooter, and you drive a tank around, trying to survive as long as possible. 

I also learned about 3d modelling in Blender and using git to do version control.
